# no-emacs
corrects your mistake for using emacs <br>
this is only for the bash shell as of now <br>
this can be installed by either making an alias to the standalone script
```bash
alias emacs="/path/to/emacsToNvimStandalone.sh"
```
or can be installed with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minegamer72/no-emacs/
cd no-emacs
cat ./emacstoNvim.sh >> ~/.bashrc
```
